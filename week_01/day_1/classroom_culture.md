# Classroom Culture

## Objectives

- introduce how the course works
- create classroom ground rules

## Intro
Rather than a bus that the instructors are driving; pointing out views while you are falling asleep.  This course can be viewed as a walking/camping adventure with challenges on the way.  Often we'll ask you to work in groups/pairs.

These challenges can be tough.  But the point of this course is that this is a safe supported protected environment, where we can all learn and fail together.  To achieve this, it's really important that the class can collaborate, support and help each other along the way.

What would be great here is that if we can, together,  come up with some rules that can help us get this environment.


## Ground Rules

Get the students into groups (5 max). Ask them to write down some rules for the class.

- 15 mins

Example rules:

- Phones on silent
- Turn up on time

Some good rules are (add at end if not suggested):

- open / closed door : when the door is open teaching is not going on and you can go for food / break etc (a lab or break is on) and if it's closed then there's no chatting / disruptions etc.
- No open drinks (risk of spillage on laptops)
- Respect other students and staff
- No "stupid questions" always ask if you are stuck!


Hammer home the idea of community, support and helping each other out.
