# Friends Lab

We have a bunch of information about a set of friends.
We're going to find out some interesting information about them using TDD.

We need to to complete the tasks in the comments of the `friends_spec.rb` file.
Write your tests in that file first, then write the function to pass the test in `friends.rb`.
There is one example test and function already.
