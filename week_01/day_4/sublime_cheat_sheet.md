# Sublime Text and Terminal Shortcuts


## Terminal

`cmd + T` in Terminal opens a new tab.

`subl <file>` - opens the selected file in sublime text.

`subl .` - opens all files in the selected directory in sublime text.

`open .` - opens the selected directory in finder.

`Tab` - Auto-complete files and folder names

`ctrl + A` - Go to the beginning of the line you are currently typing on

`ctrl + E` - Go to the end of the line you are currently typing on

`ctrl + L` - Clears the Screen, similar to the `clear` command

`ctrl + R` - Lets you search through previously used commands

`ctrl + C` - 'Kill' whatever you are running (useful for infinite 
loops)

`ctrl + D` - Exit the current shell

`ctrl + W` - Delete the word before the cursor

`ctrl + K` - Clear the line after the cursor



## Sublime Text

`cmd + S` - Saves the current file (Do this often!!)

`cmd + shift + R` - reindents the selected lines of code (be careful, and select all text first)

`cmd + T` - go to file 

`cmd + K + B`	- toggle side bar

`cmd + L` - select line (repeat select next lines)

`cmd + D` - select word (repeat select others occurrences in context for multiple editing)

`cmd + K + K` - delete from cursor to end of line

`cmd + K + backspace` - delete from cursor to start of line

`cmd + shift + D` - duplicate line(s) that you are currently on

`cmd + /` - Will comment out the current selected lines, or uncomment the current lines

`cmd + Z` - undo

`cmd + shift + Z` - redo


### Find / find and replace

If you press `Cmd + f`, a text input should appear at the bottom of the window, giving you the option of finding text in the current document. 

Alternatively if you press `Cmd + shift + F` you can search your current project.

` cmd + G` brings you to the next occurrence of the word you're searching for.

`cmd + shift + G` does the same, but brings you to the previous occurrence.

`cmd + shift + F` brings you to the search and replace menu.

`cmd + Right/Left` - moves your cursor to the end/beginning of the line


### Cursor tricks

Put the cursor before the first character, press `alt` and drag the cursor straight down to the end the paragraph. This will allow you to enter text before all of the selected lines

`Cmd + cursor click` - will set multiple blinking cursors on your file, allowing you to edit multiple elements at once.
