## Homework - Model Facebook 
#### (Do not try and make Facebook :P)

Read through the bus/passengers solution and tests to make sure you understand what is happening. 

Plan out how you might model Facebook. Draw a Class Diagram to reflect your plan.

Break it down into its smallest components and think what classes you might need to model it, and what some of the properties and methods of those classes could be. Also think about how the classes might interact with each other. 

**Draw.io** can be really helpful if paper isn't your thing - (https://www.draw.io/)

Hint: - nouns may be turned into classes or properties, verbs may be methods.
