# Pair Programming Lab - Snakes and Ladders

In pairs, implement a game of Snakes and Ladders in Ruby. 

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders)

Plan! Make a Class Diagram.

Work on one laptop and Git commit regularly. 

Remember to use TDD!

TIPS:  
It may be easiest to focus on making the simplest possible version of the game first - i.e. a board with players who move along it. Then add more functionality as you go along, such as the ability to win by reaching a certain position, and then the snakes and ladders. 

Let the testing guide you step by step to the solution - it will stop you getting lost trying to picture the whole game in your head.    

Don't try and implement your whole plan in one go and don't get too wedded to your plan if it's clear it's not practical. Don't be afraid to refine your planning if you need to.
