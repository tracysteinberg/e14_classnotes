# Guide to reviewing the sample solution 

1. Look at the snakes and ladders sample solution. 
2. Find out how to run the game (it should print out results to the terminal).
3. Try to draw a class diagram of this solution.

### Questions to consider: 

- What is different from the way you tried to solve the problem?
- Are there any parts you don't understand?
- Testing - why has the dice class not been tested?
- Why is all of the 'puts'-ing in one viewer class?
