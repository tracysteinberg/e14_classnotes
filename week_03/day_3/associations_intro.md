# Associations Intro

#### Objectives

- Explain the following types of associations:
	- One to one
	- One to many
	- Many to many

Up until now we have created single model applications which map to a single SQL table. This is pretty cool but we probably want more data to play with. 

For example, our Pizza shop might want information on their customers.

 Let's have a think - if you owned an online pizza store, what data would you want to have? Think of some of the drawbacks from our app yesterday:

- We couldn't select from a menu
- Our customers could keep 'repeating' in our table
- No customer database

It would be cool to maybe have a table for the customers and a table for the menu.

> DRAW THE FOLLOWING

```
PIZZA
id
name
size
```

```
CUSTOMER
id
name
address
debit_card_id
```

```
PAYMENT_DETAILS
card_id
```

In SQL, when we start to have multiple tables, we relate a data ( this is why we call SQL a relational database ) row to one or more data rows in another table. We can do this a few different ways.

- One to one
- One to many
- Many to many

We relate data by individual table row

## One to one

In a one-to-one relationship, each row in one database table is linked to 1 and only 1 other row in another table.

#### customers table
|  column ||
|---|---|
| id  |primary key, link to id of customer details table |
| firstname  |John|  
| lastname  |Doe|

#### customer_details table
|  column ||
|---|---|
| id  |primary key, link to id of customer table |
| address  |10 xxxxx street|  
| telephone  |0123456789|


## One to many

Now we can start working with multiple tables. Let's say we are a bank manager of multiple branches and we want to setup a database to deal with accounts.

We might have a Branches table.

```
BRANCHES
id
address
```

We may also have an Accounts table.

```
ACCOUNTS
id
name
sort
```

So every new customer gets an account. But what if we wanted to associate the account to the branch? How could we do this? 

We can setup a one to many association. We can say one branch row is associated to many account rows.  With this setup, we use the branch_id as the FOREIGN KEY. We use this foreign key to reference the ID of the associated row in the other table.

So, in account:

`branch_id`

## Many to Many

OK, let's go back to our Pizza shop. We have a Pizza table and a Customer table. What's the association here?

- A customer row can be associated to many pizzas
- A pizza row can be associated to many customers

In this situation, we can call this many to many relationship. When we have this situation we need a third table - or join table. The purpose of this join table is to track the id of the rows in the other two tables.

For our pizza example, we need a join. We can create a table, Order.

```
ORDER
id
pizza_id
customer_id
```

Here the join has two foreign keys. We can now associate customers to many pizzas and pizzas to many customers.

## TASK:

Design the following data:

- USERS & PHOTOS
- QUIDDITCH PLAYERS & BROOMSTICKS
- BASKETBALL TEAMS & PLAYERS
- ARTISTS & VENUES
