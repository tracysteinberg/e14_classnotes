# Presentations

For the presentation, you will have a 10 min slot to show off your work, with 5 minutes for questions.

We expect you to:
 - show pictures of sketches, notes, diagrams from your planning stage
 - demo your apps functionality
 - talk about one piece of code that you are particularly proud of
 - highlight your main learning points

Try not to:
 - Go over the time limit
 - Talk through every single line of code
