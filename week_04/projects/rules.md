# Project Rules

You are required to submit your link to github as soon as it has been created. We will be doing a code review at 12 noon on Wednesday.

Presentations will be held on Thursday.

The project must be built using only:
  - Sinatra
  - PostGRES SQL
  - HTML / CSS
  - Ruby

It must NOT use:
  - Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
  - JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it
  - Authentication

The instructional team will be on hand to help but we would strongly encourage you to:
- Try and solve the problem yourself by reading the error message
- Google specific terms to see if you can find the answer
- Ask your peers on the same project as you for advice

Failing this, we will come to your aid and don't spend more than 30 mins stuck on a problem without asking someone for help.

We want to see lots of meaningful Git commits and the use of TDD where / if appropriate.
