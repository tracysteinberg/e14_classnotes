# Paired Lab - Rock Paper Scissors

Create a simple Android app to allow the user to play rock, paper, scissors.

They will enter their chosen move by clicking a button, the computer will randomly pick a move to play against them.

The player will see the both the computer's choice, and the result of the game on the screen.

##### You will need:

* A button for each selection
* A (tested) Java class for the game logic
* A way to display what the computer's choice was, and the result (TextViews?)

Feel free to practice styling etc.

### Extensions:

* Add another activity which acts as a welcome page and explains the rules before the user picks their move.
* Adapt your site to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock! (see: http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html )
* Keep a score of the number of wins
