# Project Rubric - Perfect Project

## JavaScript Style 

Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

## User Interface 

The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

## Risk Taking and Creativity

Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

## Workflow

The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There is visible evidence of code review happening in pull requests and discussion around approaches.
