# Project Retrospective Brief 

 __"We do not learn from experience … we learn from reflecting on experience."__ - John Dewey 

And another wise quote!

__"By three methods we may learn wisdom:
First, by reflection, which is noblest;
Second, by imitation, which is easiest;
and third by experience, which is the bitterest"__ - Confucius

The retrospective is our opportunity to elevate the bitterness of experience into the nobility of reflection.

Enough of these quotes, cut to the chase!

## What is a retrospective?

The Project Retrospective dedicates time to reviewing a completed project and learning from both the successes and the failures so you can improve how you work in the future.

## Questions to ask yourselves

The team should answer the following questions:

 - What did we do well, that if we don’t discuss we might forget?
 - What did we learn?
 - What would we do differently next time?
 - What still puzzles us?

Another way of approaching this is:

 - What should we/I STOP doing
 - What should we/I START doing
 - What should we/I CONTINUE doing


## Other questions to ask

### General Questions

 - Are you proud of our finished work? If yes, what made it great? If no, what was wrong or missing?
 - Did we get the results we wanted and did it make an impact?
 - Which tools or techniques proved to be useful? Which not?
 - What important decisions were made during this project?
 - What compromises were made? (Things that might look like a mistake but were done for a reason.)
 
### Questions About What Worked

 - What was the most gratifying or professionally satisfying part of the project?
 - What did we do well, that if we don’t discuss we might forget?
 - What helped us to be successful as a team?
 - Which of our methods or processes worked particularly well?
 - Where did we get lucky? What can we do to ensure we succeed if we aren’t so lucky next time?

### Questions About Challenges
 - What was the biggest impediment?
 - Which of our methods or processes were difficult or frustrating to use?
 - What was painful but necessary?
 - What’s still keeping you awake at night? What did we leave unresolved?
 - What still puzzles us?
 
### Questions About Take-Aways

 - What advice would you give yourself if you were to go back to the start of the project?
 - What should we have learned from this project a year from now?
 - Are there any lessons for you personally?
 - What else could we do better next time?

## The Prime Directive

__"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.__

__At the end of a project everyone knows so much more. Naturally we will discover decisions and actions we wish we could do over. This is wisdom to be celebrated, not judgement used to embarrass"__ - Norm Kerth, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Review


## Preparing for interview questions about agile

In an interview, It's likely that you'll be asked about your experience working in a team. 

Because you have used the Scrum framework for your group project you can use key phrases in your answers which will hopefully give an interviewer an insight into your experience.

### An example

*"What experience have you had with agile?"*

"For our group project, we had a team of 4 and used the **Scrum framework** during the week.

One of the instructors acted as a **product owner** but we created the **backlog** ourselves and picked off **user stories** to plan each **sprint**. One of use acted as **Scrum master** to manage the work we were doing.

At the end of each sprint we demoed **working software**. At the start of each morning we had a **standup** to discuss what we had been working on and what we were going to do today.

At the end of the project we had a **retrospective** to discuss what we learned, what we would do differently and what was successful."

Also be prepared to answer follow up questions such as:

*"How effective did you find using Scrum?"*

*"What would you do differently if you were doing it again?"*
