Guess Who

Implement a single player game of Guess Who using React.

MVP
The player should be able to:
- ask questions to narrow down the correct answer. 
- make a guess and find out if they are right or wrong.

Make sure you start by planning out your containers and components, making a list of each of their state and props.
