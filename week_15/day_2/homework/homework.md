# Users, Shows and Favourites

We have a shows API. Now we want to add Users and Favourites.

**Users should be able to have many favourite shows and shows should be able to be favourited by many users.**

What should the relationships be? 

Draw them out and then add them to the Shows API.

Don't worry about the routes at the moment, just create the new models and database tables, and implement the relationships.
