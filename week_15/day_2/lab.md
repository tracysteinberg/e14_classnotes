# Associations Lab

## Learning objectives
 - Practice using associations in Rails
 - Practice formatting of JSON responses in Rails

## Task

Choose a domain to model using Rails - this can be any topic of your choice, however you must have:
 - A one-to-many relationship
 - A many-to-many relationship

Set up the associations and then use them to send some data as a JSON API. 

Example:

Quidditch -
  - Player belongs to a team
  - Team has many players
  - Player has many sponsors
  - Sponsor has many players.
