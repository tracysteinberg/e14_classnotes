## Final project suggested briefs and technologies

### Aim:
To consolidate what you have learned over the past few weeks, or to research and learn a new technology if you really want to challenge yourself.

The final projects allows you to create ***anything*** you want to! This can make it a little hard to come up with an idea that you want to work on. Below are a number of briefs for practicing modules from the course, and suggested technologies if you want to learn something new.

You can choose to work in groups, pairs, or on your own.

Remember, you only have a week, so don't expect to get absolutely everything finished before the presentations. You'll be presenting as usual next Thursday!
You can continue to work on your projects after the course, though, so keep that in mind.


## Suggested Briefs

# Create a React on Rails project

React.js is a fantastic framework which makes updating DOM elements dynamically much easier than it is with vanilla JS, and Rails is a great technology to use to create a backend quickly and easily. So why not marry the two?

Creating a React on Rails project is a great choice for the final project, as it allows you to consolidate the only parts of the course which don't have a dedicated project.

The plan here is to create a React frontend which is supported by a Rails backend, with a theme of your choice.

# Rewrite a previous project in a different technology

The idea here is to make sure you know the ins and outs of what you're trying to build in order to focus on the learning side of the project. Some examples of what you could do would be:

- Rewrite a vanilla Javascript project in React (possibly with Rails), and maybe adding to it.
- Rewrite a react homework in Angular (or another JS framework), and add to it.
- Integrate your Java project into an Android or iOS app.

> Remember, if you choose to use a technology which we have not covered on the course, there is no guarantee that there will be instructors with experience in it.

# Create a brand new project in a new technology

If you want a real challenge, you can choose to create a project (with a theme of your choice) in a new technology, whether it's from the list above, or a different technology of your choosing.

> Remember, if you choose to use a technology which we have not covered on the course, there is no guarantee that there will be instructors with experience in it.

### Suggested Technologies

Find below a list fo technologies which would be in the scope of learning for the final project. Please be aware that there may not be instructors with in-depth experience with the technology you're learning, and take this into account when making your decision. 

Obviously you can choose any other technology you'd like to learn, if what you have in mind is not on this list.

- Typescript
- A new JS framework (eg. Angular)
- C# (ASP.NET Core)
- SASS
- Redux

#### For all of these project briefs you are required to write your own MVP and bring it to us for approval. Try to structure it in the same way that you have seen our briefs in previous project definitions.
